# Frontend for Web Content Summarizer

This is the frontend code for a web content summarizer application. It allows users to enter a URL, and it then communicates with the backend to generate summaries and major points from the content of the provided web page.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

## Loading the Extension in Chrome DevTools

To use this frontend as a Chrome DevTools extension for web page summarization, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Frontend Folder**: Ensure that your current working directory is the `EXTENSION-FORNTED` Dir

2. **Open Chrome (or any standard Browser)**: Launch the Google Chrome web browser on your computer.

3. **Access Chrome Extensions**: Click on the three vertical dots (menu) at the top-right corner of Chrome to open the menu. From the menu, go to `More tools` > `Extensions`.

4. **Enable Developer Mode**: In the Chrome Extensions page, you should see a toggle switch labeled "Developer mode" in the top-right corner. Enable it by clicking the toggle.

5. **Load the Extension**: You will now see options to "Load unpacked" or "Pack extension." Click the "Load unpacked" button.

6. **Select Frontend Directory**: A file dialog will open. Navigate to the directory where you have the built frontend code (the directory containing the `manifest.json` file). Select this directory and click "Open."

7. **Confirm Extension Installation**: You should now see the frontend extension listed among your installed extensions. It will typically have an icon and a name matching your project.

9. **Switch to Extension Tab**: In Chrome DevTools, you should see a tab labeled with the name of your extension. Click on this tab.

10. **Use the Extension**: You can now use the extension's interface to enter a URL and generate summaries or major points from web content.
